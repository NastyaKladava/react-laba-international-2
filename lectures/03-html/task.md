# HTML practice

Create HTML page using provided [Figma Design](<https://www.figma.com/file/rDDQzjMzAjQL5NYzCQDiXd/Simple-portfolio-(only-HTML)>).

### Definition of done

- You can use only HTML (no CSS or JS or something else)
- HTML should pass W3C [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) validations. HTML should be semantic.
- Add work navigation between pages
- Put your photo instead of "YOUR PHOTO HERE" on the template. Photo should not take all page
- Full name and phone inputs should be required values on the form. This means that you can't send a form without these values

Git part:
- You should use this repository - https://github.com/qaprosoft/react-laba-international-2 (if you don't have access please let me know)
- You need to create a folder in the homeworks folder. The name should be firstName-lastName. E.g. for a developer Mykhailo Melnyk the name would be mykhailo-melnyk. The Sub-folder should have the same name as a lecture name.
- Every branch in upstream must starts with a prefix that is based on user initials. For example, for a developer Mykhailo Melnyk prefix would be mm-. In case of prefix collisions in the future the common rule is to dive deeper into the last name, for example: mmel-02-html.
- Create PR
- Once PR is created you have to do the following things:
  - Assign your mentor as a reviewer
  - Ping the mentor about the PR ;)

Good luck!
